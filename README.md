# PerimeterRightTriangle
This class implements a simple program that asks the user to input the length of the hypotenuse and a leg 
in order to compute the perimeter of a right-angled triangle.

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three sides.
However, Suppose I  want to make a program that computes the perimeter of a right-angled triangle with only a hypotenuse and a leg. 
Hence, in this case, we must first calculate the length of the other leg. 
Then, we can get the perimeter.
